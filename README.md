# Introduction

This is a demonstration of using [PourOver from the NY Times](http://nytimes.github.io/pourover/) to do filtering operations against a set of objects.

All you have to do to try it out is serve up the page using some kind of web server, I used Live Server in Visual Studio Code but you could use Apache or whatever to serve the HTML, JavaScript, and images.

I also wanted to try out [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) as a CSS framework and this gave me an excuse to do so.
